# Secure Data Hiding in Images using Steganography

## Project Description
This project focuses on developing an advanced steganographic system to securely embed and extract secret information within digital images. Leveraging techniques such as least significant bit (LSB) manipulation and encryption, the system provides a robust method for covert data transmission. The project aims to enhance data security and privacy by making the existence of the communication itself undetectable.

## Features
- **Advanced Steganographic Techniques:** Implements LSB manipulation and other advanced methods for embedding data.
- **Encryption:** Ensures the hidden data is encrypted before embedding to provide an additional layer of security.
- **Steganalysis Resistance:** Incorporates measures to resist common steganalysis attacks.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Compatible with various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Programming language used for the development of the project.
- **OpenCV:** Library for image processing tasks.
- **Cryptography Libraries:** Used for encrypting and decrypting the hidden data.
- **Steganographic Algorithms:** Techniques for embedding and extracting secret data within images.
